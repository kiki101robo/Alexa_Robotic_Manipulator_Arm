# Alexa_Robotic_Mmanipulator_Arm

A collection of ROS 2 packages for an Arduino-based robotic system with voice control integration through Amazon Alexa.

## Overview

This repository contains ROS 2 packages for a robotic system built around Arduino hardware with advanced features including motion planning, voice control, and remote operation capabilities. The system is designed to be controlled through voice commands via Amazon Alexa integration.

**Work in Progress:** This project is currently under active development. The Arduino board integration is not yet complete. Currently, the system supports simulation-based operation with plans for full hardware integration.

### **arduinobot_cpp**
C++ implementations for performance-critical components including real-time control loops, hardware interfaces, and computational algorithms.

### **arduinobot_description**
Robot description files including:
- URDF models
- 3D meshes and visual representations
- Joint configurations
- Physical parameters and constraints

### **arduinobot_moveit**
MoveIt! motion planning configuration providing:
- Path planning capabilities
- Collision detection
- Inverse kinematics solving
- Motion execution

### **arduinobot_msgs**
Custom ROS message definitions for inter-node communication including specialized messages for voice commands, robot states, and sensor data.

### **arduinobot_python_examples**
Python-based examples and demonstration scripts showcasing various robot capabilities and usage patterns.

### **arduinobot_remote**
Remote control functionality enabling:
- Web-based control interfaces
- Mobile app integration
- Network communication protocols

### **arduinobot_utils**
Utility functions and helper modules used across multiple packages including common algorithms, data processing, and system utilities.

## Prerequisites

- ROS 2 (Humble/Iron/Rolling)
- Arduino IDE or Platform IO
- Python 3.8+
- MoveIt! 2
- Amazon Alexa Skills Kit (for voice control)

## Installation

1. **Create a ROS 2 workspace:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/arduinobot_ws/src
   cd ~/arduinobot_ws/src
   ```

2. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> .
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/arduinobot_ws
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
   ```

4. **Build the packages:**
   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```

5. **Source the workspace:**
   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

## Quick Start

### Simulation Mode (Current)

1. **Launch the simulated robot:**
   ```bash
   ros2 launch alexabot_bringup simulated_robot.launch.py
   ```

2. **Launch with specific options:**
   ```bash
   # Without voice control
   ros2 launch alexabot_bringup simulated_robot.launch.py use_alexa:=false
   
   # With custom world
   ros2 launch alexabot_bringup simulated_robot.launch.py world:=my_world.world
   ```

3. **Test voice commands (if Alexa is enabled):**
   - Say "Alexa, tell Arduino bot to move forward"
   - Say "Alexa, ask Arduino bot to stop"

4. **Monitor system status:**
   ```bash
   ros2 topic echo /robot_status
   ```
## Demo Video

**[Watch Arduino Bot Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qvHi43QQj6JAHF6cioCBSAB-RQ5DIhqP/view?usp=sharing)**

This video demonstrates:
- Robot simulation in Gazebo
- Voice control integration
- Motion planning capabilities
- RViz visualization

### Hardware Mode (Coming Soon)

Hardware integration with Arduino boards is planned for future releases. This will include:
- Real-time motor control
- Sensor data acquisition
- Physical robot operation

## Usage Examples

### Voice Control
The system responds to natural language commands through Alexa:
- "Move to the kitchen"
- "Pick up the object"
- "Return to charging station"

### Remote Interface
Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080` for manual control and monitoring.

## Configuration

Key configuration files:
- `config/robot_params.yaml` - Robot parameters
- `config/alexa_skills.json` - Voice command mappings
- `config/controllers.yaml` - Controller configurations
